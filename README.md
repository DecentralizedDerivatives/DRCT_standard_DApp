![Wormhole](./src/imgs/readme.png)

Code for [https://dapp.daxia.us](https:/dapp.daxia.us)

This is a purely front-end dApp, so it can be run locally and you can still connect and trade on our Ethereum platform with a valid Metamask account.


To clone on local machine and use contracts on Ethereum network:

    git clone https://www.github.com/DecentralizedDerivatives/drct_standard_dapp

    cd drct_standard_dapp

    npm install

    npm run build

    npm start
