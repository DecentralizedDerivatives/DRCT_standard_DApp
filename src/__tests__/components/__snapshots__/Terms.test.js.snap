In the event of a fork, you agree that we may temporarily suspend our operations (with or without advance notice to you) and that we may, in our sole discretion, decide whether or not to support (or cease supporting) either branch of the forked protocol entirely. You acknowledge and agree that we assume absolutely no responsibility whatsoever in respect of an unsupported branch of a forked protocol.

Except for disputes that qualify for small claims court, or to the extent this provision is expressly prohibited by law, all disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement, your use of (including any access to) the Service (including all Transactions) and all related matters, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, will be resolved through final and binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury and you agree that Company and you are each waiving the right to trial by a jury to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. You agree that any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted, and you are agreeing to give up the ability to participate in a class arbitration or class action.

By accessing or using the Service, you acknowledge and agree (i) that we are not responsible for operation of the underlying protocols and that we make no guarantee of their functionality, security, or availability; and (ii) that the underlying protocols are subject to sudden changes in operating rules (a/k/a “forks”), and that such forks may materially affect the value, function, and/or even the name of the Token referenced on the Service. In the event of a fork, you agree that we may temporarily suspend our operations (with or without advance notice to you) and that we may, in our sole discretion, decide whether or not to support (or cease supporting) either branch of the forked protocol entirely. You acknowledge and agree that we assume absolutely no responsibility whatsoever in respect of an unsupported branch of a forked protocol.

                   This Agreement, your use of (including any access to) the Service, and all related matters are governed solely by, and construed solely in accordance with, the laws of the United States (including federal arbitration law) and the State of Delaware, U.S.A., without regard to its principles of conflicts of law that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction, and regardless of your location. Except for disputes that qualify for small claims court, or to the extent this provision is expressly prohibited by law, all disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement, your use of (including any access to) the Service (including all Transactions) and all related matters, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, will be resolved through final and binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury and you agree that Company and you are each waiving the right to trial by a jury to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. You agree that any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted, and you are agreeing to give up the ability to participate in a class arbitration or class action.

Except for disputes that qualify for small claims court, or to the extent this provision is expressly prohibited by law, all disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement, your use of (including any access to) the Service (including all Transactions) and all related matters, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, will be resolved through final and binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury and you agree that Company and you are each waiving the right to trial by a jury to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. You agree that any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted, and you are agreeing to give up the ability to participate in a class arbitration or class action.

By accessing or using the Service, you acknowledge and agree (i) that we are not responsible for operation of the underlying protocols and that we make no guarantee of their functionality, security, or availability; and (ii) that the underlying protocols are subject to sudden changes in operating rules (a/k/a “forks”), and that such forks may materially affect the value, function, and/or even the name of the Token referenced on the Service. In the event of a fork, you agree that we may temporarily suspend our operations (with or without advance notice to you) and that we may, in our sole discretion, decide whether or not to support (or cease supporting) either branch of the forked protocol entirely. You acknowledge and agree that we assume absolutely no responsibility whatsoever in respect of an unsupported branch of a forked protocol.

In the event of a fork, you agree that we may temporarily suspend our operations (with or without advance notice to you) and that we may, in our sole discretion, decide whether or not to support (or cease supporting) either branch of the forked protocol entirely. You acknowledge and agree that we assume absolutely no responsibility whatsoever in respect of an unsupported branch of a forked protocol.

Except for disputes that qualify for small claims court, or to the extent this provision is expressly prohibited by law, all disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement, your use of (including any access to) the Service (including all Transactions) and all related matters, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, will be resolved through final and binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury and you agree that Company and you are each waiving the right to trial by a jury to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. You agree that any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted, and you are agreeing to give up the ability to participate in a class arbitration or class action.

In the event of a fork, you agree that we may temporarily suspend our operations (with or without advance notice to you) and that we may, in our sole discretion, decide whether or not to support (or cease supporting) either branch of the forked protocol entirely. You acknowledge and agree that we assume absolutely no responsibility whatsoever in respect of an unsupported branch of a forked protocol.

Except for disputes that qualify for small claims court, or to the extent this provision is expressly prohibited by law, all disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement, your use of (including any access to) the Service (including all Transactions) and all related matters, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, will be resolved through final and binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury and you agree that Company and you are each waiving the right to trial by a jury to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. You agree that any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted, and you are agreeing to give up the ability to participate in a class arbitration or class action.

You agree that any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted, and you are agreeing to give up the ability to participate in a class arbitration or class action.
